Se trata de una obra descriptiva que evoca, a través de elementos de lenguaje musical, distintos aspectos de las estaciones del año.\r\nConcerto n.º 1 en mi mayor, Op. 8, RV 269, \"La primavera\" (Primavera) Allegro Largo Allegro Pastorale\r\nConcerto n.º 2 en sol menor, Op. 8, RV 315, \"L'estate\" (Verano) Allegro non molto Adagio e piano - Presto Presto e forte\r\nConcerto n.º 3 en fa mayor, Op. 8, RV 293, \"L'autunno\" (Otoño)\r\nAllegro Adagio molto Allegro\r\nConcerto n.º 4 en fa menor, Op. 8, RV 297, \"L'inverno\" (Invierno) Allegro non molto Largo Allegro\r\n\r\nOtoño (Concierto nº 3 en fa mayor, RV. 293)\r\n\r\nPrimer movimiento: Allegro\r\nLos alegres campesinos celebran con danzas y cantos la recolección de la cosecha; musicalmente, la danza está escrita en un compás de 4/4, en donde las figuras rítmicas son iguales tanto para el solista como para toda la orquesta; el cambio rítmico del solista en arpegios de dobles corcheas describe a un borrachín que, después de varias travesuras, al fin se queda dormido.\r\n\r\nSegundo movimiento: Adagio molto\r\nLos demás campesinos no dejan solo a este borrachín y lo acompañan en su embriaguez hasta que el vino y el sueño los vence.\r\n\r\nTercer movimiento: Allegro\r\nLlenos de gran entusiasmo y acompañados por los ladridos de sus perros y el sonar de sus cornos, los cazadores se dirigen al bosque.\r\n\r\nAntonio Lucio Vivaldi (Venecia, 4 de marzo de 1678 - Viena, 28 de julio de 1741), fue un compositor y músico del Barroco tardío. Se trata de una de las figuras más relevantes de la historia de la música. Su maestría se refleja en haber cimentado el género del concierto, el más importante de su época. Vivió los años de transición del siglo XVII al siglo XVIII, es decir, el final del llamado periodo barroco de la música. \r\n\r\nEn ese momento el legado histórico de la música europea era trascendental, pues había emergido de las primitivas formas del Medievo a la ejecución de varias melodías al mismo tiempo en la polifonía, estilo que diferenciaría a la música occidental de la del resto del mundo. Este género musical se desarrolló tanto en el ámbito religioso como en el profano.\r\n\r\nEn la música, el primer paso para encontrar elementos contrastantes consistió en separar la música en tres diferentes episodios, dotados cada uno de velocidad y ritmo diferentes; rápido-lento-rápido, secuencia característica de la sonata da camera, o de la sonata da chiesa, cuando el primer movimiento de ésta tenía un carácter lento o grave.\r\n\r\nOtra forma de lograr el contraste fue la de tocar un tema en su primera aparición dentro de una dinámica fuerte y luego repetir el mismo ahora de forma suave como un eco. Este efecto también se lograría utilizando el recurso de la acumulación de instrumentos, separando dentro de la orquesta de cámara a un pequeño grupo instrumental (concertino) del resto de la orquesta (ripieno o tutti), interviniendo primero toda la orquesta y luego solamente el concertino, logrando así el efecto sonoro contrastante. \r\n\r\nEn consecuencia, se originaba la forma musical conocida como concerto grosso, que a su vez originaría la forma conocida simplemente como concierto, en donde el solista demuestra sus habilidades técnicas, enfrentando con su instrumento a toda la masa orquestal.\r\n\r\nEn el concierto barroco son marcados los contrastes: en tempo (velocidad), la exposición temática en forma de eco y la lograda por la oposición de un instrumento en contra de toda una orquesta.\r\n\r\nEste reciente estilo musical tendría que adherirse a uno de los conceptos de la estética aristotélica que dominaba en la época; la imitación de la naturaleza.\r\n\r\nAntonio Vivaldi escribió cerca de 500 conciertos para diversos instrumentos, 220 de ellos dedicados al violín, instrumento del cual Antonio era un virtuoso.\r\n\r\nCuatro de estos conciertos, pertenecientes a Il cimento dell´armonia e dell´invenzione y reunidos en el Op. 8 (1725) escritos para violín solista, orquesta de cuerdas y clavecín, son los que se conocen con el nombre de Las cuatro estaciones.\r\n\r\nEn estos cuatro conciertos se encuentran ejemplificadas todas las características anteriormente descritas del concierto barroco. Se trata de obras musicales únicamente para ser escuchadas; bien definidos los contrastes de tiempo, pues cada concierto está dividido en tres partes: tempo rápido-lento-rápido; el elemento dinámico contrastante está cubierto por el efecto del eco; se tiene a un virtuoso solista que, acompañado solamente por el ''basso'' continuo, enfrenta a toda la orquesta y, por último, se cumple con la justificación artística de imitación de la naturaleza, buen pretexto para escribir una obra maestra.","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rLJ9Ev41_sk/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rLJ9Ev41_sk/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rLJ9Ev41_sk/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rLJ9Ev41_sk/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480},"maxres":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/rLJ9Ev41_sk/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280,"height":720}},"tags":["El","Otoño","Autumn","Las","cuatro","estaciones","The","Four","Seasons","Le","quattro","stagioni","Antonio","Lucio","Vivaldi","il","prete","rosso","Concerto","nº","en","fa","mayor","Op.8","RV","293","L'autunno","Allegro","Adagio","molto","Musica","Barroca","Baroque","Composers","Musicians","Music","Il","cimento","dell'armonia","dell'inventione","Contest","between","Harmony","and","Invention"]},{"id":"HSJUdiZD1dw","publishedAt":"2009-05-04T02:02:23.000Z","title":"Vivaldi-Las cuatro estaciones-invierno","description":"","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HSJUdiZD1dw/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HSJUdiZD1dw/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HSJUdiZD1dw/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360}},"tags":["invierno"]},{"id":"eW1sR-A6AA8","publishedAt":"2011-08-13T00:27:36.000Z","title":"P.I.Tchaikovsky - Danza China [del ballet \"El Cascanueces\"] [de \"Fantasía\", 1940]","description":"Orquesta de Philadelphia\r\nArreglo y dirección de  Leopold Stokowski","thumbnails":{"default":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eW1sR-A6AA8/default.jpg","width":120,"height":90},"medium":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eW1sR-A6AA8/mqdefault.jpg","width":320,"height":180},"high":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eW1sR-A6AA8/hqdefault.jpg","width":480,"height":360},"standard":{"url":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eW1sR-A6AA8/sddefault.jpg","width":640,"height":480}},"tags":["Pyotr Ilich Tchaikovsky","Danza China","El Cascanueces","Philadelphia Orchestra","Leopold Stokowski"]},{"id":"L8jKNdNyyrI","publishedAt":"2013-01-23T01:00:21.000Z","title":"Danza rusa - de la Suite de \"Cascanueces\" - Tchaikovsky - Fantasia 1940","description":"Corto animado de Disney en la maravillosa \"Fantasía\" de 1940, con música del ballet \"El cascanueces\".

It is an interesting song that tells kids about a tailor, a cobbler, a barber, a carpenter, a policeman and a postman. Kids would love to sing and role play on this song. Here are the lyrics:\n\nI am a tailor stitching clothes\nStitch, stitch, stitch my needle goes.\n\nI am a cobbler mending shoes\nRat, tat, tat and it’s just like new.\n\nI am a barber cutting hair,\nSnap, snap, snap my scissors work on your hair.\n\nI am a policeman, I stand so,\nTelling the cars to stop and go.\n\nI am a carpenter making furniture,\nBang, bang, bang goes my hammer.\n\nI am a postman, I come home\nBringing letters and parcels too.\n\nKnock, knock - this one is for you.\nKnock, knock - this one is for you.\n\nHope you like our song.
